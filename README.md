#Veto
Ever felt that you have too many things to do and cannot decide on which to complete first? Are you tired of listing down the same tasks over and over again? Do you need something to categorize your tasks? Well, worry not! Veto is here to save the day!

It is a personal assistant that keeps your tasks in order. It will tell you what needs to be done on a particular day or the coming week. It is also smart enough to create tasks that need to be done periodically.

Unlike other complicated task managers, Veto is phenomenally simple. The program only requires a single line of command. No more clicking and navigating unfriendly interfaces, and no more scrolling up and down to find the “submit” button. Veto will execute the command based on what you type. How simple is that?

Veto also allows tasks to be tagged, making sorting and filtering effortless. Tags are important when you have multiple tasks to complete and you want to classify them based on priority, category, etc. You have the option to choose the tags to add. When using Veto, we do not want you to miss any important task.

Adding, completing and viewing tasks cannot get any simpler than this. Get ready to be amazed by Veto’s suite of simple but productive features.
